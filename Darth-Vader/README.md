## Darth Vader Design

This design was used as part of a beer label called Dark Lager. Here several techniques were used to obtain an initial vector artwork which was then refined.

The choice of this Star Wars character is to play with the words "I am your Lager" to make fun of the famous similar sentence of the
film. An pertinent translation in French was found to be "Je suis ta bière", which is phonetically similar to "Je suis ton père", which was the actual translation in French of the same sentence.
