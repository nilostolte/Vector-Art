## Darth Vader Design

This design was used as part of a beer label called Dark Lager. Here several techniques were used to obtain an initial vector artwork which was then refined. First a photo of a real model of the character found on the web has been chosen. In this way, we have an accurate representation of the character without infringing any copyrights. We transfrom to black and white and vectorize the image as usual. The vectorization needs to be retouched by hand. This has been done in PostScript language as well as in a vector editor. The left eye, for example, is the right eye scaled and horizontally compressed. The grid on the mouth and overall drawing simplification has been done in PostScript. The resulting vector is an original design with no copyright. Since no names are mentioned and even the famous sentence has been modified, it is difficult for the studio to try to claim a copyright for the character.

The choice of this Star Wars character is to play with the words "I am your Lager" to make fun of the famous similar sentence of the
film. A pertinent translation in French was found to be "Je suis ta bière", which is phonetically similar to "Je suis ton père", which was the actual translation in French of the same sentence.
