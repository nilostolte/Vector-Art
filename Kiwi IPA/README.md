## Kiwi IPA

Continuing with simple designs used for the _Brexit Bitter_, this design intention is to clarify that the _Pacific Gem_ hop 
used for this IPA is actually from New Zeland. Since people from NZ are called _"kiwis"_, the name of the beer was quickly found:
_Kiwi IPA_. The vector image of a kiwi and the word kiwi written in a pacific aboriginal tatoo style add some context and decorate
a bit more the design. To complement it, constrasting and fashionable pastel colors are used. The _IPA_ word is also written with 
altered and distorted letters. The whole design has a quite modern feel even though it recalls 60's cartoons style.
