## Beer Label Designs

All these beer labels were designed entirely from scratch, from their names until the last details of the label. Giving attractive and 
fun names is often a good strategy for maketing a product. Combining with modern, unusual, and attractive artwork can easily
boost product acceptability. Here are some samples of the creativity involved in these designs.
