This design is a combination between several complex typography manipulations of glyphs of the font Egypt22 but many other design features like the vectorization of a mexican hat and the reuse of the PostScript code for the sun.

### Mexican Hat

It comes from this image dowloaded from the internet:

</p>

Which we then transform to a wireframe black and white image by simply modifying the colors one by one to white, which is afterwards vectorized:

</p>

Once vectorized we color all features again:

</p>

As a background image the colors are too intense. The colors are then faded out to be used as a background image as seen in the final art above.

The the image is vectorized using Inkscape:

Since this design is very small only the star is fixed by hand:
