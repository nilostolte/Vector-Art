This design is a combination between several complex typography manipulations of glyphs of the font Egypt22 but many other design features like the vectorization of a mexican hat and the reuse of the PostScript code for the sun and star.

The main concept was to give the idea of a mexican beer, like Sol or Corona, but "Viva Zapata" was craft, pure malt, and organic, and, thus, being kind of "revolutionary." It's the usual humor always present in the  other labels,  as well.

### Mexican Hat

It comes from this image dowloaded from the internet:

</p>

Which we then transform to a wireframe black and white image by simply modifying the colors one by one to white, which is afterwards vectorized:

</p>

Once vectorized we color all features again:

</p>

As a background image the colors are too intense. The colors are then faded out to be used as a background image as seen in the final art above.

The the image is vectorized using Inkscape:

Since this design is scaled to a very small size only the star needs to be fixed by hand:

### Typographic Details

The interesting typography details are the paint dripping effect in the letters as shown below. These effects were added to the original glyphs to produce new glyphs:
