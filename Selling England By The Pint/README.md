## Selling England By The Pint

The idea of this label is to illustrate the _Brexit Bitter_ beer, aka, _Selling England by the Pint_. This design is extremely simple and 
the trick is mainly its name, which is a parody of the Genesis song title _Selling England by the Pound_, particularly pertinent 
since Britain not only did not want to leave the pound but also left the European Union. Therefore, not only it caused a _bitter_
sentiment in the European Union but also caused economical turmoil, symbolized by several currencies in the world that are used as a
substitute for the actual letters naming the beer. Since _bitter_ is also the type of this beer, the whole humor comes actually by both 
names.

To add to the simplicity of the design, dashed arrows connect the words England to the Big Ben and the word Pint to a pint of beer.
