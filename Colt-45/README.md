## Colt 45

This is a representation of a colt 45 from the 1800's to be used in a label of a beer called _The Gunner's Choice_. 
The general idea in this design was to give an idea of the old western. Several details give additional 
hints to enhance the impression of an old western ambience. The first one is of course the colt 45 which was
completely elaborated by hand in PostScript language. Every detail in the weapon increases the realism and is important
for a convincing overall design.

### Bull Skull

Another detail that enhances the impression we are in a western kind of environment is the bull skull. The design of this
vector skull was based on a photograph of a true bull skull. Some features are reflected in respect to the middle vertical 
line, but not every detail otherwise it would denounce a flagrant computer designed feature. Since this vector artwork was 
to be used in a reduced size, the design is more rudimentary, with few details of visible size, so it can apper once it is reduced to its actual size.

### Background

Another important aspect of the design is the background pattern that recalls a saloon wallpaper.

### Final Design

Finally the name of the beer is designed with a modern font where the letters are distributed as concentric circles
as in the case of a pistol cylinder. Eventually, the appropriate colors are chosen for each element. Different tonalities 
of brown does the trick, giving the impression of a dusty environment, and it also corresponds to the color of the beer, which is a Pale Ale.
